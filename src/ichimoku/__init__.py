2 Step Process for Entering a Trade with Ichimoku

Many of you who have read the weekly Ichimoku reports or attended the DailyFX Plus webinars are familiar with
the checklist we refer to before entering a trade with Ichimoku. This checklist will let us know if weâ€™re looking
at a high probability buying opportunity (opposite applies for sell trades):

-Price is above the Kumo Cloud

-The trigger line (black line on my chart) is above the base line (baby blue line) or has crossed above

-Lagging line is above price action from 26 periods ago (above the cloud is the additional filter)

-Kumo ahead of price is bullish and rising (displayed as a blue cloud). This is currently not fulfilled.
